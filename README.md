#       Ready Made README


#       Description


    This project assignment was to create a README generator through the CLI for the user. The user is asked a series of questions, and then the users' response is then dynamically inserted into a skeleton wireframe located in one of the JavaScript files. The README file is then generated using the fs.WriteFile method. This project also uses module exports and require functions to pull in data and responses from other JavaScript files running asynchronous functions based on the users' input.
